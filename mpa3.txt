Display:

x is 5
x is -3
x is 0


Putting only one equal sign in a if-statement assigns a value to the variable
If I remember correctly, putting only a number inside the if-else statement means that any number not equal to zero is True while zero means False. That explains why all the statements were displayed except for the last one.

Display:

Ang isa ay higit sa dalawa...

(infinite iteration display of this)


The first while loop terminated because the zero means False. The following while statements resulted to an infinite display because there's no statement that makes the loop terminates.

/all characters/


When an integer is displayed as a character, it follows the ASCII code that's why in the first display those are symbols.
The second output displays the digits from 0 to 9 and the two output that follows are uppercase and lowercase letters respectively. In accordance to ASCII code as well.
I thought I was right in the 5th output but it turns out it was a beep when I ran it.
The characters is under the range of 0 to 255 so it displayed all the characters in the last output.
